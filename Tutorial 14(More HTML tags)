    <p> <strong>Software engineering</strong>  is a detailed study of engineering to the design, development and maintenance of software. 
        Software engineering was introduced to address the issues of <em>low-quality</em> software projects. 
        Problems arise when a software generally exceeds timelines, budgets, and reduced levels of quality. 
        It ensures that the application is built consistently, correctly, on time and on budget and within requirements. 
        The demand of software engineering also emerged to cater to the immense rate of change in user requirements and environment on which application <sub>or</sub> websites is supposed to be working.</p>
